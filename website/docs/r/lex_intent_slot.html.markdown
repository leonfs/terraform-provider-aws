Identifies the version of a specific slot.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_lex_intent" "order_flowers" {
  slot {
    description = "The type of flowers to pick up"
    name        = "FlowerType"
    priority    = 1

    sample_utterances = [
      "I would like to order {FlowerType}",
    ]

    slot_constraint   = "Required"
    slot_type         = "FlowerTypes"
    slot_type_version = "$LATEST"

    value_elicitation_prompt {
      max_attempts = 2

      message {
        content      = "What type of flowers would you like to order?"
        content_type = "PlainText"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

### Required

* `name`

	The name of the intent slot that you want to create. The name is case sensitive.

    * Type: string
    * Min: 2
    * Max: 50

### Optional

* `description`

	A description of the bot.

    * Type: string
    * Min: 0
    * Max: 200

* `priority`

	Directs Lex the order in which to elicit this slot value from the user. For example, if the 
	intent has two slots with priorities 1 and 2, AWS Lex first elicits a value for the slot 
	with priority 1. 
	
	If multiple slots share the same priority, the order in which Lex elicits values is arbitrary. 

    * Type: number

    * Max: 100

* `response_card`

    The response card. Amazon Lex will substitute session attributes and slot values into the

* `sample_utterances`

    If you know a specific pattern with which users might respond to an Amazon Lex request 
    for a slot value, you can provide those utterances to improve accuracy. This is optional. 
    In most cases, Amazon Lex is capable of understanding user utterances.
