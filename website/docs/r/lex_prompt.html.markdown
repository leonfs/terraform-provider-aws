# aws_lex_prompt

Obtains information from the user. To define a prompt, provide one or more messages and specify the 
number of attempts to get information from the user. If you provide more than one message, Amazon 
Lex chooses one of the messages to use to prompt the user.

## Example Usage

resource "aws_lex_bot" "order_flower_bot" {
  clarification_prompt {
    max_attempts = 2

    message {
      content      = "I didn't understand you, what would you like to do?"
      content_type = "PlainText"
    }

    response_card = "..."
  }
}
```
